## Installation
```bash
npm install nextcron
```

## Usage
Here's a quick start example:

```javascript
import { NextCron } from 'nextcron';

const nextcron = new NextCron('your-api-key-here');

// Publish a job
await nextcron.publish({
  topic: 'my-topic',
  target: 'http://myapi.com/endpoint',
  method: 'POST',
  data: { key: 'value' }
});
```

### Delaying a Job
Delay job execution by specifying a delay in milliseconds.

```javascript
await nextcron.publish({
  // ... other options
  opts: { delay: 60000 } // Delay of 1 minute
});
```

### Retrying a Job
Configure retry strategies for your jobs.

```javascript
await nextcron.publish({
  // ... other options
  opts: { attempts: 5, backoff: 30000 } // Retry up to 5 times with a 30-second backoff
});
```

### Scheduling Jobs

Use CRON expressions for scheduling tasks.

```javascript
await nextcron.publish({
  // ... other options
  opts: { repeat: { pattern: '0 */2 * * *' } } // Every 2 hours
});
```
